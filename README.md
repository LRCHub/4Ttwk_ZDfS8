B-b-b-baby c'mon over
I don't care if people find out
(Da da, da da da, da da da da)
They say that
we're no good together
And it's never gonna work out
(Da da, da da da, da da da da)
But baby you
got me moving too fast
Cause I know you wanna be bad
And girl
when you're looking like that
(Da da, da da da)
I can't hold back
Cause you,
you've got this spell on me
I don't know what to believe
Kissed you once now
I can't leave
Cause everything you do
is magic
But everything you do is magic
So l-l-let them take
the pictures,
Spread it all around
the world now
(Da da, da da da, da da da da)
I wanna put it on my record,
I want everyone to know now
(Da da, da da da, da da da da)
But baby you
got me moving too fast
Cause I know you wanna be bad
And girl
when you're looking like that
(Da da, da da da)
I can't hold back
Cause you,
you've got this spell on me
I don't know what to believe
Kissed you once now
I can't leave
Cause everything you do
is magic
But everything you do is magic
Woah, oh oh oh oh oh
Woah, oh oh oh oh oh
Woah, oh oh oh oh oh
Everything you do is magic
They say that
we're no good together
And it's never gonna work out
I wanna put it on my record,
I want everyone to know now
Everything you do is magic
Everything you do is magic
Everything you do is magic
Everything you do is magic
Cause you,
you've got this spell on me
I don't know what to believe
Kissed you once now
I can't leave
Cause everything you do
is magic
But everything you do is magic
Woah, oh oh oh oh oh
Woah, oh oh oh oh oh
C'mon
Kiss you once now I can't leave
Cause everything you do
is magic
But everything you do is magic
